// the ISBs are actually necessary on Cortex-M0 to avoid a 2-instruction
// delay in the effect of enabling and disabling interrupts.
// That probably doesn't matter here, but it's hard to say what the compiler
// will put in those 2 instructions so it's safer to leave it. The DSB isn't
// necessary on Cortex-M0, but it's architecturally required so we'll
// include it to be safe.
//
// The "memory" and "cc" clobbers tell GCC to avoid moving memory loads or
// stores across the instructions. This is important when an interrupt and the
// code calling disable_irq/enable_irq share memory. The fact that these are
// non-inlined functions probably forces GCC to flush everything to memory
// anyways, but trying to outsmart the compiler is a bad strategy (you never
// know when somebody will turn on LTO or something).

/* Lightweight assert macro to replace standard assert()
 *
 * Standard assert() needs fprint, __FILE__ , __LINE__ string consts etc.
 *
 * stm32's library has "USE_FULL_ASSERT" to enable some checks, but they have
 * their own assert_param() macro that also passes in __FILE__, __LINE__ so
 * I'm not sure if (and how) it'll be possible to combine both.
 *
 * Interesting notes on
 * https://barrgroup.com/embedded-systems/how-to/define-assert-macro
